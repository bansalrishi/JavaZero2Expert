Java is a very popular language, but it has a few drawbacks. One of the most popular drawbacks is that we still need to write the boilerplate codes like getters, setters, and toString() method in Java whereas Kotlin and Scala, which are also JVM based donâ€™t need so, and hence, this is the reason for their increased popularity in the community. This is where Lombok comes into the picture and overcomes this drawback of Java.
